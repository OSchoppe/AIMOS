# AIMOS
AI-enabled Mouse Organ Segmentation

This repository contains the code to apply or adapt AIMOS, a deep learning processing pipeline for the segmentation of organs in volumetric mouse scans. This code goes along with two examplary datasets:
* Native and contrast-enhanced micro-CT: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018294 
* Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LL3C1R

Please note that we also provide a fully functional live online demonstration on CodeOcean:
