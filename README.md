# AIMOS
AI-enabled Mouse Organ Segmentation

This repository contains the code to apply or adapt AIMOS, a deep learning processing pipeline for the segmentation of organs in volumetric mouse scans. 

This code goes along with two examplary datasets:
*Native and contrast-enhanced micro-CT*

*Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy*
